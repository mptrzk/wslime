Wslime is a repl thingy for interactive development of webapps via 
tools similar to [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime).

[here be GIF]

Future usage *(probably different)*:

    wslime [options]
    
    options:
    -p [port]
    -s [server_middleware...]
    -j [client_middleware...]

The middleware will allow you to use typescript,

### Why?
    
resetting state is tedious\
evaluating stuff in command line repl is also tedious\
interactivity is fun

Slime-like systems make it easy to wriet persistent commands,
which are easy to re-evaluate
