Wslime is a repl thingy for interactive development of webapps via 
tools similar to [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime).

[here be GIF]

usage: 

    wslime [-p PORT]


### Why?
    
resetting state is tedious\
evaluating stuff in command line repl is also tedious\
interactivity is fun

Slime-like systems make it easy to wriet persistent commands,
which are easy to re-evaluate

original lisp slime and its vim ports

jpalardy's slime evals blocks separated by empty lines,
which is more crude, but I find it to be a feature more than a bug.
It comes in handy when I redefine a function, because [TODO: reasons]
